# Ralph Loop Help

The Ralph Loop plugin provides auto-continuation for complex tasks in anubis.

## Available Commands

### `/ralph-loop <task>`
Start an iterative development loop that automatically continues until the task is complete.

Example:
```
/ralph-loop Build a REST API with authentication
```

The AI will work on your task and automatically continue until completion.

### `/cancel-ralph`
Cancel an active Ralph Loop before it completes.

Example:
```
/cancel-ralph
```

## How It Works

1. **Start**: `/ralph-loop` creates a state file at `.anubis/ralph-loop.local.md`
2. **Loop**: When the AI goes idle, the plugin checks if `<promise>DONE</promise>` was output
3. **Continue**: If not found, it injects "Continue from where you left off"
4. **Stop**: Loop continues until DONE is found or max iterations (100) reached
5. **Cleanup**: State file is deleted when complete

## Completion Signal

When the task is fully complete, the AI outputs:

```
<promise>DONE</promise>
```

This signals the loop to stop. The AI should ONLY output this when the task is truly complete.

## State File

Located at `.anubis/ralph-loop.local.md` (add to `.gitignore`):

```markdown
---
active: true
iteration: 3
maxIterations: 100
sessionId: ses_abc123
---

Your original task prompt
```
